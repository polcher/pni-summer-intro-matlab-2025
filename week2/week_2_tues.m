%% Arrays 
% write down an matrix of numbers (using variable naming guidelines)

% write down a string of characters

% write down a cell array consisting of your matrix and your string

%% Matrices
% Use the following matrix:
my_matrix = [2 5 4; 1 7 8; 10 11 12];

% Select the value 7 from this matrix using row and column indexing


% Select [4,8,12] from this matrix using row and column indexing


% Select the value 7 from this matrix using one index


%% 3 Dimensional matrices 
% Use the following matrix:
my_3D_matrix(:, :, 1) = [1 2; 3 4; 5 6];
my_3D_matrix(:, :, 2) = [7 8; 9 10; 11 12];
my_3D_matrix(:, :, 3) = [13 14; 15 16; 17 18];

% Select the value 3 from this matrix

% Select [13 15 17] from this matrix

% Select [3,6] from this matrix

%% Define two matrices, concatenate and multiply

% Create a 3X4 nans matrix and randi matrix and concatenate them in the row dimension. 
% Create a 3X4 ones matrix and randi matrix and concatenate them in the column dimension.
% Take the transpose of the randi matrix and multiply the two matrices (non-element-wise)
% Reshape the randi matrix into a 6x2 matrix
