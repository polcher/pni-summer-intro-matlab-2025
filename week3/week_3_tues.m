%% Exercise 1
% 1. Create an array of integers going from 20 to 1 with a step of 2. 


% 2. Find what integer is at index 4. 


% 3. Find what index the number 6 is in this array. 


%% Exercise 2
% 1. create a 3X4 matrix using the rand() function.


% 2. find indices of the elements greater or equal to 0.5


% 3. replace these elements with nan.


% Challenge: replace all the numbers in your matrix which are smaller than 0.3 with
% 100. Do not use find(). 


%% Exercise 3
% create a matrix of 8x8 random integers up to value 10.


% find indices of elements bigger than 3 and smaller than 7. 


% find indices of elements either smaller than 2 or bigger than 9. 


% make these into a function that receives a matrix as an input and outputs two arrays
% of indices. 


%% Exercise 4
% 1. How can you test if at least any of the elements in a matrix are not 0?

%2. How can you test if all the elements in a matrix are not 0?
